Jaynes, A Utility for training ML models on AWS, GCE, SLURM, with or without docker 
===================================================================================

|Downloads|

Overview
--------

The reality of ML training in universities is that we use what ever
hardware we are given (for free). This means that we might have a few
beefy GPU machines, an HPC cluster, plus some GCE/AWS credits that we
get through grants. `Jaynes <https://github.com/episodeyang/jaynes>`__
is a well-designed python package that makes running across these
inhomogenous hardward resources a pleasure.

**install** (requires unix operating system.)

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install jaynes

To run **locally**:

.. code-block:: python

   import jaynes

   def training(arg_1, key_arg=None):
       print(f'training is running! (arg_1={arg_1}, key_arg={key_arg})')

   jaynes.config(mode="local")
   jaynes.run(training)

Setup
-----

Jaynes has gone through a large number of iterations. This version
incorporates best practices we learned from other open-source
communities. You can specify a ``jaynes.yml`` config file (`copy one
from our sample project to get started! <example_projects>`__) for the
type of hosts (ssh/docker/singularity) and launchers
(ssh/ec2/gce/slurm), so that none of those settings need to appear in
your ML python script. When called from python, Jaynes automatically
traverses the file tree to find the root of the project, the same way as
git.

For example, to run your code-block on a remote computer via ssh:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # your_project/jaynes.yml
   version: 0
   verbose: true
   run:  # this is specific to each launch, and is dynamically overwritten in-memory
     mounts:
       - !mounts.S3Code
         s3_prefix: s3://ge-bair/jaynes-debug
         local_path: .
         host_path: /home/ubuntu/
         container_path: /Users/geyang/learning-to-learn
         pypath: true
         excludes: "--exclude='*__pycache__' --exclude='*.git' --exclude='*.idea' --exclude='*.egg-info'   --exclude='*.pkl'"
         compress: true
     runner:
       !runners.Docker
       name:   # not implemented yet
       image: "episodeyang/super-expert"
       startup: "yes | pip install jaynes ml-logger -q"
       work_directory: "{mounts[0].container_path}"
       ipc: host
     host:
       envs: "LANG=utf-8"
       pre_launch: "pip install jaynes ml-logger -q"
     launch:
       type: ssh
       ip: <your ip address>
       username: ubuntu
       pem: ~/.ssh/your_rsa_key

In python (your code-block):

.. code-block:: python

   # your_project/launch.py
   import jaynes

   def training(arg_1, key_arg=None):
       print(f'training is running! (arg_1={arg_1}, key_arg={key_arg})')

   jaynes.run(training)

Using Modes
-----------

A lot of times you want to setup a different run **modes** so it is easy
to switch between them during development.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # your_project/jaynes.yml
   version: 0
   mounts: # mount configurations Available keys: NOW, UUID,
     - !mounts.S3Code &code-block_mount
       s3_prefix: s3://ge-bair/jaynes-debug
       local_path: .
       host_path: /home/ubuntu/jaynes-mounts/{NOW:%Y-%m-%d}/{NOW:%H%M%S.%f}
       # container_path: /Users/geyang/learning-to-learn
       pypath: true
       excludes: "--exclude='*__pycache__' --exclude='*.git' --exclude='*.idea' --exclude='*.egg-info' --exclude='*.pkl'"
       compress: true
   hosts:
     hodor: &hodor
       ip: <your ip address>
       username: ubuntu
       pem: ~/.ssh/incrementium-berkeley
   runners:
     - !runners.Docker &ssh_docker
       name: "some-job"  # only for docker
       image: "episodeyang/super-expert"
       startup: yes | pip install jaynes ml-logger -q
       envs: "LANG=utf-8"
       pypath: "{mounts[0].container_path}"
       launch_directory: "{mounts[0].container_path}"
       ipc: host
       use_gpu: false
   modes: # todo: add support to modes.
     hodor:
       mounts:
         - *code-block_mount
       runner: *ssh_docker
       launch:
         type: ssh
         <<: *hodor

now run in python

.. code-block:: python

   # your_project/launch.py
   import jaynes

   def training(arg_1, key_arg=None):
       print(f'training is running! (arg_1={arg_1}, key_arg={key_arg})')

   jaynes.config(mode="hodor")
   jaynes.run(training)

ToDos
-----

-  ☐ more documentation
-  ☐ singularity support
-  ☐ GCE support
-  ☐ support using non-s3 code-block repo.

Done
~~~~

-  ☒ get the initial template to work

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install jaynes

Usage (**Show me the Mo-NAY!! :moneybag::money_with_wings:**)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Check out the `test_projects <example_projects>`__ folder for projects
that you can run.

To Develop
----------

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/episodeyang/jaynes.git
   cd jaynes
   make dev

To test, run

.. code-block:: bash

   make test

This ``make dev`` command should build the wheel and install it in your
current python environment. Take a look at the
`https://github.com/episodeyang/jaynes/blob/master/Makefile <https://github.com/episodeyang/jaynes/blob/master/Makefile>`__ for details.

**To publish**, first update the version number, then do:

.. code-block:: bash

   make publish

Acknowledgements
----------------

This code-block is inspired by @justinfu’s
`doodad <https://github.com/justinjfu/doodad>`__, which is in turn built
on top of Peter Chen’s script.

This code-block is written from scratch to allow a more permissible
open-source license (BSD). Go bears :bear: !!
